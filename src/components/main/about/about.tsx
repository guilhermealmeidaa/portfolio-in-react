                        Hello, my name is Guilherme. My interest in web development started right after the pandemic, when I had an endless college vacation and ventured into totally random subjects, like gastronomy. Fortunately, I also found the development area, which I have been passionate about ever since.

                    Moving forward to today, I had the opportunity to work in some start-up's. Among them, MadeiraMadeira, the company where I work today in the development team in the Front-End area. My main objectives today are based on improving my knowledge and developing more and more autonomy.

                    I also participated in the robotics team at Universidade Federal do ABC, where I fell in love with programming and vibrated a lot in several competitions.
